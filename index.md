Hi, my name is Alberto Sadde (aesadde). I recently graduated from the MSc in
Computer Science at Oxford University where I focused Functional Programming
and got interested in Machine Learning.

I am interested in these areas as well as general software
engineering. I am always looking for opportunities to further my technical
abilities and gain managerial skills. Feel free to <a
href="mailto:albertosadde@gmail.com">contact me</a>.

You can check what I've been up to recently by looking at my [Now](/now.html)
page. You can also check some of my latest [Projects](/projects.html) or you can
read my [Blog](/blog.html) where from time to time I share what I think and
write about topics and problems that I find interesting.

Alberto was born in Venezuela were he studied and lived until he was 20 years
old. After two years at Universidad Simón Bolívar in Caracas, Venezuela
studying Computer Engineering, he transferred to the UK to study Mathematics
and Computer Science at the University of York. As part of his programme, he
worked at BAE Systems' Advanced Technology Centre as a Research Scientist
focusing on parallel and GPU programming. More recently, Alberto graduated from
the MSc in Computer Science at Oxford University.

Other than Computer Science and Mathematics Alberto enjoys all sorts of sports,
especially if they are outdoor or if there is water involved. He is always
trying to play [Underwater
Rugby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underwater_rugby) and loves introducing
people to the sport.

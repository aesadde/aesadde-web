<h1> Alberto Sadde </h1>

Hi, I am Alberto. I mostly like to de-construct things and understand how they
work. I also love to build new things (such as this site). Some of my small
projects are available on my [GitHub](www.github.com/aesadde). I am an avid
[reader](link-to-list-of-books) and I might even write about what I read from
time to time. My [blog]( blog.html ) contains my thoughts and discussions about
recent projects.

The best way to contact me is through my email [ albertosadde at gmail dot
com ]( mailto:albertosadde@gmail.com ).

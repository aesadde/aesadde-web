title: What I'm doing now

<div id="now-content" class="mainContent">

This is a [Now page](http://nownownow.com/about). It details what I am
currently focused and working on.

As of 15/11/2016 this is what I've been up to:

* I am taking some time off in Africa (my first time in the continent) while I decide what to do next.

* I am improving my knowledge of Haskell and Functional Programming (I'm learning more about type systems and Category Theory). I've been
watching Bartosz Milewski's Category Theory [lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PLbgaMIhjbmEnaH_LTkxLI7FMa2HsnawM_&v=I8LbkfSSR58).

* I am redesigning this site using Hakyll.

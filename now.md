title: What I'm doing now
---
Until the 30 of August I am mostly working on my masters thesis at Oxford
University. I am trying to blog about my progress on it here.


Other things I am doing now:

* I am also trying to figure out my next trip. Any ideas?
* I am trying to figure out what to do after I submit my thesis. Probably get a
job!
* I am trying to read at least 25 pages of non-university related material.
  I've recently entered a "Facebook" book exchange which should provide plenty
  of good books to read in the coming weeks. Nevertheless I am currently
  reading:
      - Vagabonding, by Rolf Potts
      - Saladin, by John Man
      - Billions and Billions, by Carl Sagan

This sums up what I am currently doing. I'll update this site once my priorities
changes or if I engage in other interesting activities!

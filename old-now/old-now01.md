Until the 30 of August I am mostly working on my masters thesis at Oxford
University. I am trying to blog about my progress on it here.


Other things I am doing now:

* I am trying to figure out my next trip. Any ideas?
* I am trying to figure out what to do after I submit my thesis (get a job maybe?).
* I am trying to read at least 25 pages of non-university related material.
  I've recently entered a "Facebook" book exchange which should provide plenty
  of good books to read in the coming weeks.

This sums up what I am currently doing. I'll update this site once my priorities
changes or if I engage in other interesting activities!

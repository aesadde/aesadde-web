I just graduated from an MSc at Oxford and I'm currently looking for my
first full-time job.

When not panicking about the job-hunting and interview process I keep myself busy
as follows:

* I am designing a query and stats engine for Haskell packages (more on this
later).

* I am improving my knowledge of Haskell (I'm learning more about type systems and Category Theory).

* I am playing with different ways to implement a digital  ["notecard
system"](http://ryanholiday.net/the-notecard-system-the-key-for-remembering-organizing-and-using-everything-you-read/).

For my masters thesis I implemented  Moran and Sands' abstract machine for
improvement theory.

<span class="proj-info">Objectives:</span>
<ul>
<li>To interpret programs in GHC Core and to provide a means to test whether
a program is an improvement of another by using the abstract machine's "tick
algebra".
</ul>

<span class="proj-info">Current Status:</span>
<ul>
<li>This project is not actively maintained nor I plan to keep working on it.
</ul>

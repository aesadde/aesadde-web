<span class="proj-info">Objectives:</span>
To interpret programs in GHC Core and to provide a means to test whether
a program is an improvement of another by using the abstract machine's "tick

<span class="proj-info">Current Status:</span>
This project is not actively maintained nor I plan to keep working on it.
